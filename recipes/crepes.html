        <ul class="recipe">
            <li>2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (12 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups (470 milliliters) milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) vegetable oil plus more or butter for the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheader-two">Cooking instructions</h2>
        <ol class="recipe">
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the milk until combined and no lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the eggs, followed by the vegetable oil. If too thick, slowly add a little more milk. If too thin, slowly add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and allow to rest at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a large nonstick skillet or pan over medium low heat. Lightly grease with oil or butter.</li>
            <li>Once thoroughly heated, add 1/4 â€“ 1/3 cup (60-80 milliliters) batter to the center and immediately tilt the pan in a circle to coat the bottom in a thin layer.</li>
            <li>Cook until set on the top and the bottom turns golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook until the other side is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove to plate. Rub the pan with more oil and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with sour cream, jam, honey, and/or sweetened condensed milk.</li>
