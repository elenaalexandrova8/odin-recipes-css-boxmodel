                <ul class="font list-text">
                    <li>3 medium-sized eggplants</li>
                    <li>salt</li>
                    <li>black pepper</li>
                    <li>cooking spray</li>
                    <li>150 grams or 1 1/2 cups walnuts</li>
                    <li>100 ml or 1/2 cup very hot water</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon khmeli suneli</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
                    <li class="listelement-nomargin">3 tablespoons pomegranate seeds to serve</li>

                <h2 class="subheader-one">Cooking instructions</h2>
                <ol class=" font list-text">
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 180 ºC (350 ºF). Slice your eggplants lengthwise with a sharp knife. Spray the baking tray with cooking spray and arrange eggplant slices on it. You may need more than one baking tray for this amount of eggplants. Lightly spray the tops of the eggplant slices with cooking spray, then sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Bake 15 minutes, then flip them over and bake for 15 minutes more</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile prepare the filling: crush the walnuts with a mortar and pestle until they look like on the picture above. Add minced garlic, khmeli suneli, ground coriander, white wine vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix everything and slowly add hot water in the bowl, stirring constantly, until you like the consistency. Don't pour in all the water at once, as you may not need that exact amount.</li>
                    <li class="listelement-nomargin">Fill each eggplant slice with 1-2 heaped teaspoons of the walnut mixture and roll. Optional: garnish with pomegranate seeds. Enjoy!</li>
